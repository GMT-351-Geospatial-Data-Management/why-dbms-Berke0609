**Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?**

  Databases allow us to easily access, modify and store data. The database consists of tables, each table contains records of information stored in rows and columns. 
 In addition, databases store information more efficiently and help us more conveniently manage information that cannot be managed in a spreadsheet. 
 Thus, we can save time and access information more easily.
 
 **What are the advantages / disadvantages of using a DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel)**
      
                 **DBMS**                                                         **Spreadsheet**
 It is a collection of inter-related data.                            It is an electronic graph sheets with rows and columns.
 It stores and retrieve the data.                                     It stores and analyzes the data.
 It provides support for data organizing and selecting.               It provides support for complex calculations.
 DBMS capacity is only limited by the computer.                       Spreadsheets hold limited amount of information.
 It is more towards the linkage and organization of data.             It is more towards calculations.
 It can do simple calculations.                                       It can do simple data organizing and selecting.
 Efficient data handling. (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access.)      Inefficient data handling. (Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1-2-3.)
