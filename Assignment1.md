**Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?**

  Thanks to databases, we can easily access, modify and store data. The database consists of tables, each table contains records of information stored in rows and columns.
 In addition, databases store information more efficiently and help us more conveniently manage information that cannot be managed in a spreadsheet.
 The data in spreadsheets is limited, we may not be able to manage large-scale data or cause data to be lost.
 On the other hand, since the data in databases is unlimited and easily accessible, we can save time and access information more easily.
