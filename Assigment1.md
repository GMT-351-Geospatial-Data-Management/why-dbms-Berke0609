**Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?**

  Thanks to databases, we can easily access, modify and store data. The database consists of tables, each table contains records of information stored in rows and columns.
 In addition, databases store information more efficiently and help us more conveniently manage information that cannot be managed in a spreadsheet.
 The data in spreadsheets is limited, we may not be able to manage large-scale data or cause data to be lost.
 On the other hand, since the data in databases is unlimited and easily accessible, we can save time and access information more easily.


 **What are the advantages / disadvantages of using a DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel)**

 **DBMS**
It is a collection of inter-related data.
It stores and retrieve the data.
It provides support for data organizing and selecting.
It is more towards the linkage and organization of data.

Efficient data handling. (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access.)

**Spreadsheet**
It is an electronic graph sheets with rows and columns.
It stores and analyzes the data.
It provides support for complex calculations.
Spreadsheets hold limited amount of information.
It is more towards calculations.
